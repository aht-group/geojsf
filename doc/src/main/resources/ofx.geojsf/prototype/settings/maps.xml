		This system page contains all created thematic maps with additional information in several languages like English and French. 
                A thematic map consists of different layers (which are managed in the GIS Layer Page) and combine them into one thematic map. 
                The first step to create a new thematic map is to add a new item to the list by clicking on the green plus. 
                After you assign a name to the new map and edit additional information, add new layers to the thematic map. 
                A preview will show your current composition of layers on the right side.
                Please note that you are able to change the order of every layer by drag and drop to the right position.
