		You can define WMS services and layers in the services page.
                These defined services are divided into several sub sections called categories. 
                Therefore it is possible to edit these categories by rename, remove or adding new items to the category list.
                All categories in this list consists of a layers list which contains linked layers. It is also possible to edit items like in the case of the category list.
                Every layer has several attributes, for example the attributes category and service, which assign a layer to the edited attributes. 
                After creating a new item, the system is able to show a preview of the new layer.
