        In this section, the WMS services can be configured, as well as the layers that are offered by
        these services. The layers are categorised so that they can be managed more easily. Categories can
        hold layers from different services, so that you can combine them with logical topics.
        See Figure <ofx:reference target="image.geojsf.admin.include.services"/> for details.
